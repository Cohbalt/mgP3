## HOW TO PLAY
To play the game you must pick up the key in the right-side up orientation (cord facing down, metal pad facing up). To start, place your finger on the exposed metal pad located at the top of the key.

After the short jingle letting you know that you started the game, you can now start tilting the far end of the key up and down, holding it in the same right-side up orientation described before. Once you're at a specific angle that you'd like to test, you can place your finger on the conductive pad to lock in that angle. While holding the pad, slowly rotate the key clockwise from the initial position. If you feel a vibration, stop rotating, or else you will lose the game. This indicates that the position you're currently in is not the correct position. Keep note of how far you were able to turn the key before a vibration occurred and reorient the key into the upright position while releasing the button.

Continue repeating the previous steps, keeping note of which direction (up or down) causes the vibration to occur further into the clockwise rotation. The closer you are to the objective, the more you should be able to turn the key without feeling a vibration. If you come across the correct angle, you should be able to turn the key 90 degrees, winning the game.

The game will provide one of two jingles depending on whether you won or lost. Afterwards, the game then sends you back to the main menu, made clear by the main menu jingle, and you can hold the metal pad to play again.
